*** Important:* This program helps the user to encrypt and store logins and notes securely in their computer.* Make sure you are using the CORRECT master password before you save and load.* The secure password is used to load and save encrypted files. Using the incorrect password, data will not be loaded correctly.* Currently, the default password is "masterpassword". Once you load the list, you can enter a different master password and then save. This will update the password to encrypt the list.* You need to remember which password you used when you save and load the list.* Also, you can use different master passwords to protect different lists.* Be careful when you modify and/or save the list, the master password must be correct. This program cannot verify the correctness of the password. The user must remember the master password.***********************************************************************************1) To save an (encrypted) list to a file    a) Choose the group name (e.g. home) and make sure the password is correct    b) Click the save button    c) The current list (login or notes) will save to a file2) To load the list from a file    a) Choose the group name and make sure the password is correct    b) Click the load button    c) The list (login or notes) will be loaded3) To add an item (login or note) to a list    a) Choose the group name    b) Enter the item information and press add button.
